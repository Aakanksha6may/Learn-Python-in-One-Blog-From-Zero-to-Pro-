## 🛠️ 1. Setting Up: Python & VS Code (Step-by-Step)

### ✅ Step 1: Download Python
1. Visit: [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2. Click the yellow **Download Python** button
3. Check the box **"Add Python to PATH"**
4. Click "Install Now"

🎉 Done. Python is now on your system.

### ✅ Step 2: Download VS Code
1. Visit: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download for your OS and install

#### 🔌 Install Python Extension:
- Open VS Code
- Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
- Search "Python" by Microsoft and install

### ✅ Step 3: Test it!
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
- Right-click in VS Code > Run Python File in Terminal

Output:
```bash
Hello, world!
```

## 🌤️ 2. Python Basics (Variables, Data Types, Input, Output)

```python
name = "Aakanksha"
age = 23
height = 5.6
is_coder = True
```

**Data Types:** `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`

```python
print(type(name))
print(type(age))
```

### 💬 Taking Input
```python
your_name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Nice to meet you,", your_name)
```

### ➶ Type Conversion
```python
num = int("5")
pi = str(3.14)
```

### ✅ Mini Practice:
- Take name and age from the user
- Print: "Hi [name], you’ll turn [age+1] next year."

---

## 🔁 3. Control Flow (If/Else, Loops)

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You're an adult!")
elif age > 12:
    print("Teenager, huh?")
else:
    print("Still a kid!")
```

### 🔄 Loops
```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Number:", i)
```
```python
i = 0
while i < 3:
    print("i is", i)
    i += 1
```

### ⛔ Break
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```

### ✅ Mini Practice:
- Print numbers 1 to 10, skip 5
- Guess a number until user gets it right

---

## 📦 4. Data Structures

### 📋 List
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("mango")
print(fruits[1])
```

### 🔗 Tuple
```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
```

### 🧹 Set
```python
nums = {1, 2, 3, 3}
print(nums)
```

### 📕 Dictionary
```python
person = {"name": "Ravi", "age": 30}
print(person["name"])
```

### ✅ Mini Practice:
- List 3 favorite movies
- Dictionary with name, city, profession

---

## 🩹 5. Functions

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Anya")
```

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 4)
print(result)
```

### *args and **kwargs
```python
def total(*nums):
    return sum(nums)

def show(**details):
    print(details)
```

### ✅ Mini Practice:
- Function to return product of two numbers
- Function with name and age

---

## ⚠️ 6. Error Handling

```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(10 / num)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
except ValueError:
    print("Not a valid number.")
finally:
    print("Done trying!")
```

---

## 👑 7. Classes & Objects

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

my_dog = Dog("Bruno")
my_dog.bark()
```

### ✅ Mini Practice:
- Car class with brand, model, method `drive()`

---

## 🛋️ 8. Modules, Packages, Pip

```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))

import random
print(random.randint(1, 10))
```

Install a package:
```bash
pip install requests
```

Use it:
```python
import requests
res = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
print(res.status_code)
```

---

## 📂 9. File Handling

```python
with open("notes.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Python is amazing!")
```
```python
with open("notes.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
```

---

## ⚡ 10. Advanced Features

```python
squares = [x*x for x in range(5)]
```
```python
add = lambda a, b: a + b
print(add(2, 3))
```
```python
def count_up(n):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        yield i
```
